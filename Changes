Revision history for Perl extension OpenCA::DB.

2.05  Fixed seachItems with the SERIAL attribute. Currently if
      a search is performed on the SERIAL and there is a match,
      the item is returned nevertheless the other search attribs
      matching or not.

2.04  Few bugfixes. Delete Item was not working right with the
      search attributes.

2.02  New DB_File usage. Now it is mandatory to have BerkeleyDB
      PERL module installed (as well as the DB itself!). Check
